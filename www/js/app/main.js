// This file hosts the main game module.  Whenever it makes sense to
// put something in its own module, you can either put it in the dependency
// array for this module (i.e. in the array containing 'game-shim'), or you
// can call require() directly closer to the time you need it.  
// <http://requirejs.org/> has detail documentation.

define(['game-shim'], function (require) {
